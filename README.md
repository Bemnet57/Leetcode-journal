# Leetcode Journal

This repository documents my problem-solving journey with LeetCode, Codeforces, and other competitive programming platforms.  
It serves as a learning log and progress tracker

## Structure

- `notes/` → Patterns and key takeaways
- `contests/` → Contest submissions
- `progress-log/` → Weekly progress reports

## Goals
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Develop speed and accuracy for timed contests
- Track growth over time through journaling
